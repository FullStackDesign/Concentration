The purpose of this project is to show you how to complete all required tasks from the [assignment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u-b4agSQqKBROU5dTKryHz6nwdqDWS8G/view?usp=sharing). If you are interested in learning how to create this project from scratch than check out my video series(click image above).

Some of the major differences of this project are:
- Redesigning the project completely.
- No Interface Builder.
- Everything is done in code.
- Playable in portrait orientation only.
